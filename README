Zend framework installer for fuelphp applications
-------------------------------------------------

* What is this?
  It's a simple script that enables you to access Zend libraries inside your 
  FuelPHP application

* Usage
  - Check out this repo on a separate path outside your fuelphp application
  - Copy install_zend.php inside your fuelphp application (top level)
  - Run `php install_zend.php` 
  - The package is installed under fuel/packages/zend
  - Zend framework is installed as a git submodule

* Update
  - Since Zend framework is installed as a git submodule you can run
    `git submodule update --init` and keep up to date
  - Remember that you should run `php install_zend.php` after you update 
    Zend framework so the new version `bootstrap.php` file
